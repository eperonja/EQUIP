1 - Extract all the files from EQUIP_xxx.zip

2 - Use this folder or move somewhere else in your computer (/Users/Public is recommended for Windows). 
    You need to check that all these files have been extracted:
	  EQUIP_xxx.jar
		freehep-jminuit-1.0.2.jar
		jcommon-1.0.23.jar
		jfreechart-1.5.3.jar
		junit-3.8.2.jar
		librxtxSerial.jnilib (only needed for Windows, however, some Mac libraries may also access this file)
		RXTXcomm.jar
		README
		rxtxSerial.dll (only needed for Windows)
		-->You might need to get the 64 bit version from /downloads
	
3 - Install driver from Silabs. A restart might be needed and connect the detector.
	  (Download from: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
	  -->You can also get it from /downloads
	
4 - If you are using a MAC:
	  Open a terminal window
	  Type 'cd /var'
	  Type 'sudo mkdir lock' (This will ask you for sudo password)
	  Type 'sudo chown -R [user]:wheel /var/lock' (where [user] is your username)

5 - Install Java
      -->For this version of EQUIP, install the jre 8 202 from /downloads
      -->Windows: JAVA_HOME and PATH need to be set to this java version
         to check, open the command window and type: 
         java -version
         the output should be:
         java version "1.8.0_202" for EQUIP to work

6 - To test if the install is successful (either a MAC or PC): 
	  Open a terminal window (MAC) or cmd window (PC)
	  type 'cd /path/to/folder/EQUIP_xxx'
	  type 'java -jar EQUIP_xxx.jar'
	
	  If everything is OK you will see output (in the terminal or cmd window) like the following and a java application called EQUIP will open up:
	  *******************************************
 	  Experimental:  JNI_OnLoad called.
	  Stable Library
	  =========================================
	  Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
	  Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7
    *******************************************
    
    If you get any other output, please copy/paste it in an email to help@i2u2.org.
     
7 - Error: "librxtxSerial.jnilib" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. The options are to 'Move to Trash' or 'Cancel'. Select Move to Trash and then drag it back to the EQUIP folder. Then proceed back to terminal and run 'java -jar EQUIP_date.jar'

    A second way to solve this untrusted developer problem is to issue command
	 'sudo spctl --master-disable'

	 after getting EQUIP to run once, you may be able to turn this gatekeeper back on with 
 	 'sudo spctl --master-enable'

		
8 - If you are installing EQUIP on a Raspberry Pi, you need to install the RXTX library. Open a command window and run:
	  sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
	  
	  Then, go to the folder where you downloaded and extracted EQUIP and run EQUIP by using this command:
	  java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni -cp /usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar:. -jar EQUIP_xxx.jar
	
9 - If you are using any other OS and are not able to get EQUIP to run, please send an email to help@i2u2.org. Other users that have successfully
    installed EQUIP using other OS may be able to help you with your questions.
