1 - Install driver from Silabs. A restart might be needed and connect the detector.
	(Download from: http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)
2 - Extract all files from CosmicRayDetector.zip
	This will create a folder called CosmicRayDetector in your default download area.
2 - Use this folder or move somewhere else in your computer.
3 - If you are using a MAC:
	Open a terminal window
	Type 'cd /var'
	Type 'sudo mkdir lock' (This will ask you for sudo password)
	Type 'chown -R [user]:wheel /var/lock' (where [user] is your username)

4 - a-Double click on CosmicRayDetector.jar or
    b-Open a Terminal Window, go to the CosmicRayDetector folder and execute: java -jar CosmicRayDetector.jar.
    In my opinion, option b is better because you will see right away if the program has any problems or exceptions occur.

NB: you need at least Java 6 in your machine for this to work.
To test, open a terminal window and type: java -version.

6 - To build the jar: 
	in the bin file (after re-building the whole project)
	jar cvfm EQUIP_02JUN2014.jar EQUIP.mf EQUIP*class TitlePage*class title.html images
	then, deploy the EQUIP.jar inside a folder with all the libraries:

	EQUIP.jar
	data
	freehep-jminuit-1.0.jar
	jcommon-1.0.17.jar
	jfreechart-1.0.14.jar
	junit.jar
	librxtxSerial.jnilib
	RXTXcomm.jar
	
7 - Ubuntu 
	sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
	sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
	sudo reboot
